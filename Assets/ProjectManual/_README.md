# Introduction

This is the project manual for **Project Keep Me Rollin'**.

Every information that is required for developing with the Project KMR team will be documented here. Such information includes:

- Project folder structure
- Coding styles and guidelines
- Project contribution format (semantic version for this project, Pull
Request format, etc.)
- Milestones and progress reporting methods
- Team roles
- Documentation format

and more...

You can think of this as a general guidelines for how to unify the development process so it is easier for others to join in. So project team members should document their work and tell everyone how you want others to handle your work. Project docs are meant for internal use but you shouldn't assume that others might already know what is what. Think of the docs as a way to express your creative works.
Please keep in mind that you are not expected to read all the docs, but you are expected to understand the parts that is related to your task.

This README doc acts as an introduction to the entire docs so please feel free to add or change the contents as you write more docs.

# Abbreviations & Definitions

To increase the efficiency of communications between members, it is good to use abbreviations. If there are any abbreviations (and the definition of that word) you are using that is foreign to other new members, please add it here.

- PR: Pull Request (when merging a branch or a fork to the master
repository)
- KMR: Keep Me Rollin' (the name of this project)
- Repo: Repository (Git repository)
- doc: Documentation (Projects documentation like this one will be referred to as docs)
- WIP: Working In Progress
- impl: short for implement or implementation
- LGTM: Looks Good to Me (used when a PR does not have any issues and is good to merge)

# Project Language

Most developments will be done in **C#** and comments and documentations **must** be written in **English**. Please make sure to keep the grammer correct. If you have any trouble, feel free to ask others to fix your English (I know English is hard).
For normal communications, you can speak in any language you like, but make sure that any written documentations meant for multiple people (project cards, docs, comments, etc.) is in English!

# How to Write Docuements

Project docs like this one must be written in Markdown. I recommend using [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io) to write a quick doc, or use the [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extension for VS code. Documentations should be long and comprehensive so anyone can understand.
As a general format, think of this README doc as a template to start from.

## Q: What should be a doc?
Anything that requires more than one people to work on either now or in the future. Or if you have any special requirements regarding your work or working style, write a doc to express that to other members.

## Q: Who can write a doc?
Anyone within the team. You will need other's permission to edit an existing doc (except for fixing typos or obvious problems), but creating a new one is completely up to you.

## Q: Any word requirements?
It should be comprehensive, but not boring. There are no strict word count but it should be long enough to let the reader understand what you want to say and short enough to not make the reader fall asleep.
